Some interesting typos/discoveries found during my event script deep dive for Double Trouble.

- One of Rennala's students will never be chosen by Rennala (entity ID typo). Tweeted this.
- Godfrey Phantom's first-time trigger requires you to damage Margit in Stormveil Castle, not him. Tweeted this.
- When the Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree fight starts, the game sets *Malenia's* network update rate to Always
rather than Loretta's.
- Loretta's phase two music flag is apparently never enabled.
- One of Malenia's spirit summons does not have its lock-on point adjusted like the others.
- Actually, that Malenia summon is not one of the four spirits she creates in her big attack. Instead, it is used in
some kind of cut attack handled by non-called event 15002840, which is triggered by Malenia effect 18037. Or, this
could be an old version of Phase Two they did, since it seems to disable the original Malenia (and she isn't re-enabled
anywhere else).
